# AngularScaffolding
AngularScaffolding is a seed project designed to get you up and running with an angular project. This particular scaffolding 
adds a few items with an eye toward allowing your application to scale. It provides you with modularized development artifacts,
as well as the tools necessary to minify and concatenate your project.
